# Unreal Engine | NPC Behavior System

I utilized unreal engines behavior tree and blackboard blueprints to develope all of the functionality and NPC commands. After sometime studying on AI behavior and working in unreal to build my game design skills I wanted to create a project that can be help full as a prototype design for different uses. The project is **still in development** with the basic NPC behaviors completed and being able to patrol on a set path with patrol points, and at key points being able to activate "action events" that can allow the npc to call on random custom events within the BP NPC to perfomr different social actions! This project was the key stepping stone in devloping my skills in unreal and building my knowledge of devloping AI. In the near future I plan to add many different behavior types so that maybe others will be able to use my system in their design to help in the game development process!

The brain of the NPC this is where all the most important task take place for the NPC's functionality.
